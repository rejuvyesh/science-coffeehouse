5 theorems, 4 of which are independent theorems and the last one's supposed to be a joke!

1. Take any point on a pizza, slice it up into 8 slices arbitrarily, but at 45 degrees. The sum of the alternate areas is equal to the sum of the other ones = half the total area.
In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of squares on all sides is invariant.

2. Any point on pizza. Take points on the circle separated at 45 degrees. Same statement holds.
proof 

3. If you create a complete n-graph on a circle, the number of divisions of the circles caused is $C(n,0)+C(n,2)+C(n,4)$
