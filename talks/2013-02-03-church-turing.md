how problems in different subjects are essentially the same problems.
subjects included - computer science(complexity), physics, math,
cognition,
Read : paper shut up and calculate.
in quantum mech, u have a mathemmatical structure ad u are able to calculate
but there is no physical interpretation.
the paper says, we have an interpretation as the interpretation is the
mathermatical framework!
Roger Penrose : there are three worlds mathematical, mental and physical... but
unable to fid a connect
Shut up and calculate says that the only world is mathematical and the other
two are parts of it?

Church-Tuing Thesis:(comsci)
Principle: (physics) if you have a turing machine (a machine with a
deterministic algorithm) you can solve related problems... a superset of all
such machines called the universal turing machine can solve all problems (of
this kind) 

problem in comsci: P=!=NP
NP: cannot solve in polynomial time but can verify
P:  can b solved in polynomail time

A. Levin : If a pseudo random number generator exists, it can be represented as
a one-way function. 

when we talk of randomness in science, is there an actual randomness or are we
ignorant? we are ignorant

Subject-object problem: nobody knows the boundary between the subjective and
objective realm. in every field, the boundary is placed acc to the subject
studied. 

after a point observer cannot be excluded from the obective reality. 

cognition: John Searle, chinese room argument
a man in a room with a rule book (to translate chinese) and a few sentences in
chinese. he can successfully translate without actually understanding things.
this can b done by a machine. and can go on forever, but where did the meaning
of the sentence come from?
