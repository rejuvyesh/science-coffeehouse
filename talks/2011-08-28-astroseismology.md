Pulsations in stars- Surface oscillations give information aout interior of the star- gradient of speed of sound, density gradients..
(hearing the music of stars :P)
Can tell where the ionisation zones are, where the helium is in which state etc.
higher order modes- asymptotic analysis, which is easier to handle.
x" = -k(r)x, where x= (c^2)(d^1/2 )(del. delta r) (c = speed of sound, d = density)
k = (1/c^2)[s^2(N^2/w^2 - 1) + w^2 - wc^2]  wc = (c^2/4H^2)(1- 2 dH/dr)
For very high w( >> N), things happen that cannot be justified in the present context, so he'll get to hand waving_

Various models- have a number of parameters that can be varied..
