## Basics
Energy Levels <- Solving Schrodinger's 
$\hcap \del{\psi}/\del{t} = H{\psi}$
Special States that satisfy [$]\H \phi = E \phi[\$] -> Stationary States == Solve the equation
Phase factor; Born Interpretation - experimentally valid is |\phi|^2
How system evolves with time...
Eigen States are solutions
[$]\Hcap = \pcap^2/2m + V(x)[\$]

## Black-body distribution curves
Describe as photons of various frequencies moving around

Let N_n and N_m be the number of atoms in respective states
[$]N_n/N_m = exp(-h\nu /k_B{T})[\$]
No. of atoms going frm m to n = \rho_\nu*N_m*B_m^n
No. of atoms going frm n to m = \rho_\nu*N_n*B_n^m + N_n*A_n^m
Equating and T-> \infnty, \rho_\nu -> \infnty
we get, B_m^n = B_n^m
therefore, \rho_\nu = (A_n^m/B_n^m)/(exp(h\nu/k_B{T})-1)  ____(1)

Spectrum --- brightness of some frequency

**Black body curve**

E = h*\nu , n\lambda/2 = L
use Equipartition theorem

According to classical mechanics : \rho_\nu d{\nu} = 4\pi/c^3 \nu^2 d\nu * 1/2*k_B*T*2	____(2)

From (1) and (2) at high temperatures:
(A_n^m/B_n^m) = 4\pi h \nu^3/c^3 ___(Still true)


** Concluding part --- Why does it happen?
Interaction with the modes of the electroagnetic field of the vacuum.
_Second Quantization_: It's not really a spontaneous emission. (stray photons allowed by uncertainty principle can cause stimulated emission, which is observed by us as spontaneous).
