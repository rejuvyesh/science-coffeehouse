we don't know what part of the brain detects timbre of sound..
It is said that listening to Mozart increases spatial temporal intelligence (ability to manipulate 3d images)
1. Only temporary, though..
2. Prolonged exposure- permanent effect.
3. Epileptic people-llowers the number of epileptic attacks.

Is this effect due to the fact that music activates certain neurons?
Made rats "listen" to music- 3 sets- Mozart, Phillip, one without any music. Those that did listen to Mozart and sonatas performed better in certain tests..

Mozart's and some other effective music- have long term periodicity, treat some notes differently.
