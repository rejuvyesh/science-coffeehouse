wall and two masses- m and M. one body hits the one closer to the wall. Eventually they move to the right away from the wall after some number of collisions P. (depends on m/M).
interesting- 
m/M      P
1        3
100      31
10000    314
.
.

Let x = position of nearest body, y = position of the farther one..
plot a weighted co-ordinated system- X = sqrt(m)x, Y = sqrt(M)y
In this one- all collisions are simple reflections in the line y = x (or Y = sqrt(M/m) X)
and the Y axis.
Reflect Y axis in this line, the trajectory of the line would now simply be the vertically straight line, with P= number of lines encountered.

P = [pi/alpha]
alpha = arctan (m/M)
