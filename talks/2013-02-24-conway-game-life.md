zero player game. one gives initial conditions and game proceeds. 2d grid of cells. dead black square alive white square. Generations (iterations)

Rules of game-
if live cells have 0, 1 neighbours, it dies.
2,3 live lives
3  dead->alive
3+x live dies

* Still Life (equillibrium like)- z..................................................independent of generations after a certail poit eg 2x2 

* Oscillators 3x1 /time period 1 generation
Note- Certain time periods not possible.

* Space ships translates/ eg Glide 12,23,31,32,33 

Gosper Gun. shoots gliders. it is an initial condition that starts shooting gliders at gen 30 and shoots gliders after at every 15 gen.

gliders can be used as inputs (glider is one and no glider is zero) a gosper gun can be used to configure an algorithm. 

garden of eden: an initial state. no other 

this can be used to simulate neurons
