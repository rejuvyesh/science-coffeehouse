# About Us

Science Coffeehouse is IIT Kanpur's Science Discussion group. It started off in 2010 as a informal group of enthusiasts led by [Ish Dhand](http://www.iqst.ca/people/peoplepage.php?id=350) and Pranjal Nayak (Y8), and then grew into a hobby group. We meet once a week, gather around a white-board for discussions on different topics lead by whoever has read about the topic. The best part: everyone comes to the Science Coffeehouse session with an idea that they've read about and goes back with many more. Apart from the discussions, we have with the help of GLDC invited renowned Indian Scientists to the campus for talks and interactive sessions with the students. If you've ever found yourself lost in questions of life, the universe and everything; then, my friend, Science Coffeehouse is the place for you!
