wonders how to begin :P

given a nucleotide  seq.. what is the secondary structure ... dna= > double helix rna=> many 

hairpin loop etc... important for predicting properties of sequence

computational treatment... points on a semicircle... bonds represented by lines between nodes
some structures ruled out... secondary nodes... recursive algorithm more efficient
dependance on salt concentration... steric and symmetry effects

counterion condensation theory... finiteness of the partition function requires b<l_B... implication that one cannot have an arbitrarily large charge density on a rod in salt soln... applied to dna and rna ... deducible that dna has a greater salt dependant correction to the free energy
