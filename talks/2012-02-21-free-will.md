Benjamin Libet- claims the above..
Shocking experiment that measured 'readiness potential'
Volunteers asked to look at a clock and perform a task, and were asked to pinpoint the exaact time when they felt the urge to do something. Brain was mapped.
Found that half a second earlier than wanting to perform the act, the brain was already preparing to perform the tasks, the consciousness was 'informed' only later!
Free will doesn't reside in consciousness.. (!) (Then whose will is it? Is it "free"?)
