CRE ages-
When a meteor falls to earth, cosmic rays bombard it from time t0 to t1 when it enters the atmosphere..
t1 -t0 = cosmic ray exposure age.
iron meteorites have very large ages compared to other ones ~ 3-4 million years, while it's around 1 million years for other types.
Radiation momentum on a meteor leads to a net angular acceleration (comes due to rotation about the axis)
del(k del T) = pCp dT/dt    k - conductivity, T- temperature
k del T. n = ae + aeT^4     

\\ heat equations..

da/dt = f(lv, theta)  lv = heat penetration depth
theta  = ....
a = semi major axis.
For large k, temperature is almost constant throughout the surface, negligible angular force.
Very small k- again a negligible angular force.
Maximum when k is moderate.

Iron meteors have higher k, ....
