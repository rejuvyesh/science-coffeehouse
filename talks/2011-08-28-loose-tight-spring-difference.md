Stretch a spring and leave it, a compression wave moves down the spring, gets reflected with a phase change of pi.
e- characterises points on the spring wrt total length. 
Equation of the spring- k(d2y/de^2) + (m)g = (m)d2y/dt2
T'(e,t) = k(dy/de - l) and dy/de(free end) = l(0)
also, dy/dt(t=0) = 0
Therefore, T' = mg(1-e)        T' = tension
y(e,t) = (l0 + mg/k)e - (mg/2k)e^2

Homo part-
y1(e,t) = 0 [0, t/T < e]       T = sqrt(m/k)
= mg/k(t/T - e) [e<t/T<2-e]
= mg/k(2t/T - 2)

Wave velocity is gT
Tightly bound spring- 
Account for width of the coils of the spring.

we get t = sqrt((m/3k)e^3) (time taken by wave to reach the bottom)
