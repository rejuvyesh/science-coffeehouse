Cannibalistic behaviour in beetles when they dont get food.
<Model this behavior - exponential terms model cannibalism>. Found : larvae eat eggs most, death rate much lower than birth rate (typical of cannibals).

Artificially adjusting death rate (he killed so many!! :O).. (No Shreya- he took some out)
Theoretical model - bifurcation. He experimented - somewhat similar results..but not quite..
