Powerful bursts- long and short periods..
Long period bursts associated with supernovae explosions.
Model- collapsar model.
Star rotating on its axis- equatorial bulge. Most particles emanating from the core that we observe come through the poles.
Why are the gamma ray bursts so rare near our galaxy?
Distribution of these bursts is more or less uniform throughout the universe, and come from large distances.
weak supernovae- depleted H and He region, but lesser resistance for gamma rays, hence stronger.
Strong supernovae with less depleted regions, have weaker gamma ray bursts 'cos of the greater resistance.

Short period bursts-
two rotating neutron stars merging together give a short period burst.
black hole and companion stars- different stars with different rotation rates, rub against each other, exact cause of these radiation not known.
