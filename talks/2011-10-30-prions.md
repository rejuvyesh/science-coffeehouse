Europe(many years ago 1900s), tried to increase yield of wool. Sheep went mad. Event came to be knwn as scrapie..
Microbes at play? No.
matter of sheeps brain injected into another caused this in another sheep! 
Holes in brain, clumps of tissue.

The fore (tribe) disease (kuru 1950s) || to that of scrapie.
Kuru- Affected were mostly women and children.. Funerel cannibalism.
Men ate muscles and women ate organs and brain.
Who attended funelers only got affected.

Thus, tranmitted orally or thru injection.
/*/
CJD (1980s)(genetic? due to jews closely knitted developing the disease) (very rare) (europe and asia)- || symptoms to kuru. 
ELectrodes probing in humans also caused disease too.
Resisted medical sterilisation.

ALso thru hormones injected.

Curious gene- produces a protien resistant to protease. Protease risistence protein (253 codons). alpha helix. named prions.
And be converted to a beta sheet [bad prion] (condensed) can induce this in normal protien.
prion- protein+infection.
Species specific.

Cows (Britain)- mad cow disease (1980s), cattle industry- meat supplyment caused prions to pass on. 5yrs incubation time

High incubation time.
