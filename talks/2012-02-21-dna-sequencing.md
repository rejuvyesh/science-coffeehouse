repeat of IISER-T's Mimamsa talk:
Old methods of sequencing DNA nucleotides:
Sanger sequencing: DNA strand and a primer
Primer- 'marks' the start and end points for replication of polymerase chain. Is a specific sequence; subsequent nucleotides are added complentarily.
Adding ddntp stops replication at various stages- gives chains of various lengths.

Illumina sequencing:
Similar one- break into smaller fragments, allow them to congregate and replicate, take "photos" as it is forming.

New method: Ionic solution and membrane:
