Non examples- two particles moving head on, rotating observer, light spot on moon
An example that troubled observers was one in which a galaxy emits jets of particles in a cone of half angle alpha.
Anomaly was because of lag in travel times.
Schankorf effect: the velocity of light is dependent on the density of virtual particles in vacuum. In the Casimir effect the density of virtual particles between the plates is "lesser" than normal. It IS possible for a photon to move faster than c. (Merely prediction)
