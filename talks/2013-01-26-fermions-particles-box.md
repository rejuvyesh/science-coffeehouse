If there are many particles in a box, bosons can all sit in the same level, but not fermions- only one per state- they are filled up to a certain level..
For very low temperatures, bosons prefer to clump into the single ground state.

Cooper pairs: 
Sea of Electrons in a lattice.
Add an extra electron, it repels some electrons around it. It appears as an electron with some positive charge dressed around it. (quasi particle)
Two quasi particles- intuitive thinking says that they must repel each other. 
But they don't. They induce dipole moment in each other and attract.

Thus, they can form a bound state. Now, the spins in the bound state add up, and behave like a boson.
This is a Cooper pair.

Electrons scatter off each other among various levels and lose energy.
Cooper pairs are bosons and hence in the same state, and do not scatter amng themselves -> Feel no resistance, superconductivity.

What happens at a junction between superC and normal Conductor?

(there is aother kind  of quasiparticle, like a hole)
At junction, there's a coupling between an electron going into the super-C (sc) and a hole gtting reflected off the barrier.

Schroedinger equation:
$|H -E_f		Delta	|*	|U|= E	|U|$
$|Delta*		-(H-E_f)|	|V|=	|V|$
