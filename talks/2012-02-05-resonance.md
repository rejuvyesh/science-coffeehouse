Huckel number- 4n + 2 -aromatic. (Filled bonding orbitals)
Draw a circle around benzene, with a vertex at the bottom, make an orbital diagram- at each vertex and divide by a line.
Lower ones - Bonding orbitals, on the line- non bonding, above- antibonding.
Bond order - 0.5(# bonding - #antibonding) - decides stability

Nine membered ring with Oxygen at one end, and alternate double bonds- not aromatic, in spite of being planar..
A lot of electron density at the oxygen end, because of an extra lone pair at Oxygen (only one participates in the resonance)
