1. Image copying, parabolic mirrors(which give spherical aberration :P): Mona Lisa- perspective difference between left and right..
(Da Vinci was right handed, so, mirror and lens placed only on one side). 
The background is projected on the painting and then copied.. foreground is easy to draw.
Copying images- difference arises between a photographed and a copied image.
Change the position of the lens to look at different regions of the object to be drawn and the image gets distorted.
Depth of field - The area he can paint without changing the position of the mirror/lens. This IS the size of the painting!!

2. Pointillism
Colours of the same hue and make points. Go far away and you can't resolve. Sparrow resolution distance. 
Burger face, icecream bird! :P :D

3. Multiple intereferences of a film of paint: Depth visualisation came in with the advent of oil paintings

Multiple reflections from oil -> different shades from different angles.
