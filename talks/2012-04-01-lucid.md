Pisupati- lucid dreaming
Dreams usually happen in REM sleep. Are a storm of neural signals interpreted in a way.
Don't hallucinate while awake 'cos of sensory feedback.

Lucid deraming involves active awareness of the dream. Happens while fallig asleep/waking up.

While falling asleep, the body must go to sleep after the mind does. The mind checks whether the "conscious" part has gone to sleep or not by prodding it (that's why we change position, feel itchy..)
Chest feels heavy..

(Hypnagogic hallucination)
