Faganos problem-
Acute angle triangle, take any 3 points on the 3 sides- form a triangle. Minimise the perimeter of this triangle:
Solution: (side info- a pedal triangle has the least possible perimeter among such t)
Construction: U lies on AB. Join AU. reflect the line about AB and AC. take arb points on both sides AB and AC (v and w), join.
now, uv=u"v, uw=u'w.
minimise perimeter- minimise u"v + vw + wu' - happens when it's a st line. (minimises for a fixed u.)
now to minimise u
angle a+b = constant
perimeter/sin(a+b)=k*side
thus min side
side minimised when perpendicular..
thus pedal triangle.

American mail delivery paradox
Size=girth
Girth=l+2pi*r [cylinder]
for general= l+ permiter [distorted cylinder]
Max(vol/size)
Cannot be a sphere..
Not a cube.
A cylinder.
