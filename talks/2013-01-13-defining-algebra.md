## Rings

existence of inverse not necessary
divisibility is a property of multiplication

\there exists c \in Z

a, b \in Z, R, C

not true for all

Z x Z = {(a,b)|a,b \in Z}


(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+b, c+d)
and another

additional ring condition applied ab=0

*Divisibility defined only for integers*

## What's prime?
1) a|p
a=+-1, +-p  <--- irreducible

2) p|ab => p|a or p|b  <--- prime

one of them implies the other but not converse.

### What's GCD?
Order not necessary to define GCD
a,b , d
i) d|a, d|b
Divisiblity is partial Order...
\alpha|a, \alpha|b -> \alpha|d
a<=b if a|b
1) a<=a 2) a<=b, b<=c -> a<=c 3) a<=b, b<=a -> a=b
least wrt to divisibilty Order

### Euclid's Lemma

\for every a,b
\there exists q, r
a=bq+r, 0<r<b

Similarly for polynomials in R and C but not Z
Fields

#### Different kinds of Rings
polynomials in the field...

#### Unique factorization
n = +-p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}...p_n^{\alpha_n}

Z[\alpha] = {a+b\alpha|a,b \in Z} <- defins a ring for any \alpha

Irreducibility in Z
p = ab, a=+-p, b=+-1 <- another way to define Irreducibility

Therefore, p is irreducible if p -> not unit and p = ab -> a or b is a unit
