Can't trisect any general angles, can't do many things with Euclidian geometry.. (cube root of 2)
operations allowed- using straight edge, compass. Points that can be got are called ruler and compass points.
Something called field- collection of numbers such that whenever a, b, c belong to F,
a + b, a - b, ab and a/b (b!=0) also exist in F. It's a Euclidian field if sqrt(a) also belongs to F.

The ruler and compass numbers form a Euclidian field.
Suppose d belongs to F,
p, q belong to F, but sqrt(d) !b to F
We can define a quadratic field F(sqrtd) = p +q(d)^1/2 - will be a Euclidian field.
Tower field- if there are many such numbers, we can keep extending the field this way to arrive at a Euclidian field.

given a polynomial- ax^n + bx^(n-!) + .... + h = 0
If p/q is a root, then they both divide h and (p, q) = 1
If the coefficients are integers: 

Cubic equation- all coefficients rational.
Thm- if the roots are non-ratonal, then they are not constructible.
