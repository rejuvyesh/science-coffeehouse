Information is physical. not isolated from laws of physics.
Earlier, cs involved abstract Turing machines.
A physical model is necessary to realize all this ( bits, bytes) 
Consider many molecules in a box, with a partition.
Two state system- can store memory and has tasks like deleting, writing, (reading?)
Delete- remove partition
write- push molecules to one side.

Work MUST be expended to store information.
Entropy- delta S= -k ln(2)
Information- the energy required to erase all data and reset it to zero.

// using the system to run an engine- getting energy from the molecules destroys the information stored in it. (but we have already read it, otherwise we cannot get any net energy from the system)

Maxwell's demon:
Demon with a trap door, can preferentialy allow molecules to get to any side.
I resolution- expense of energy is necessary for the trap door. (what if I have a simulation?)
II resolution- knowledge is required by the demon if he wants to decide. This involves reading a tape of information, and to make it reversible one does need to expend energy..
