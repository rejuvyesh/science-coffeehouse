Entropy = Infomation for the time being, counted as bits.
Analogue- Sea with fish, and a whirlpool at the bottom. have a limit- none can exceed the speed of sound.
Fish at "event horizon"- where the speed of water is the same as that of sound. Its sound cannot reach an other fish outside the "black hole".
Where does the information go?
Acc to Susskind- information conservation is the -1th law of physics.
Photon getting absorbed in a black hole- One bit of information is dealt with if we consider the wavelength to be comparable to that of the size of the black hole. (Smaller wavelength- have to further specify where in the black hole it got absorbed. More information)
Schwarzschild radius- R = 2MG/c^2
mass of photon- h/Rc
dR = 2Gh/Rc^3
Delta (R^2) = 4hG/c^3
INformation stored - proportional to area, not volume!
This is Bekinstein bound- Maximum information stored in a given area. (Defined generally, black holes satisfy this bound)
String theory!
Black hole is like a puddle of strings..
Wiggles in strings proportional to energy, entropy..
T = hc/Rk

Black hole is a hot bit soup. If Alice falls in, she does not come to know. (One more view is that she comes into contact with the event horizon and vapourises as Hawking radiation).

Are these two views contradictory?

Let's consider Bob outside- wants to find out whether she burns or not. Decides to measure, must send a high energy photon.
Apparently it is this measurement that burns her!

Consider a room with molecules- the info whether a voxel has a molecule or not is  a bit. Project the info on to a 2d surface. This is like a hologram.

The resolution, then, is that the info in a black hole is projected on to the area. (outer area)
BH is a hologram.

Pranjal- No. of ways to tie a tie
85 ways to tie, and 13 of them are aesthetic..
Passive end (smaller and stationary), and an active end.
Initial configuration- Active end can lie on the right, left or centre. In or out. Symmetry => only Rin or R out considered.
Ending the tie- (Rout*Lin*Cout) and other configurations. Symmetry does not work..

Nice drawing, to be continued next time!
