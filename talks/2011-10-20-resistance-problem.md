problem of forming a resistance of 1.41 ohm given only 20 1 ohm resistors. (sqrt2 requires infinite resistors)

Optimization problems.
polygon garden with 3 houses and a main gate. Problem- to design a path that covers all houses with the minimum possible distance.
Geometrical solution: reflect the polygon about one side.
Transformations (reflections about various sides) to map AB + BC + CD + DA into a line.reflect the mapped points back (inversse transform) to get B,C, and D.

Brachiostochrone problem:
Start from origin, to reach (x0, y0), upward acceleration g.
v= sqrt(2gy) = dl/dt.
T = Integral(dx sqrt(1+(dy/dx)^2)/ 2gy))
must minimise not a variable, but a whole path.
define theta= angle made with vertical. Fermat's principle- refractive index goes as 1/v(y), hence sin(theta)/v(y) = constant.
These constraints are satisfied by the cycloid.

Sachin modi:
poses the problem- tautochrone for two points on the earth.

= 1.41 nothing special about 1.41 could be any rational number.+
