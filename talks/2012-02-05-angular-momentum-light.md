Experiments show that circular polarised plane waves have angular momentum, Mondal claims that these experiments are wrong, in spite of the theory being correct..

Angular momentum
J = 1/4*pi*c Integral (d3r)rx(ExB)
Formula shows that direction of angular momentum is perpendicular to the direction of propagation for a wave.

Helmholtz theorem:
$E = -grad (f) + curl (F)$
$f = \frac{1}{4}*pi Integral(div(E) dV/|r-r'|$
$F = 1/4*pi Integral(curl(E) dV/|r-r'|$

Actually, $E = -grad(V) + dA/dt$
--Heavy vector identities and manipulation.--
J = Jo + Js.

Explicitly proves that for a linearly polarised plane wave, there's no angular momentum.
Circularly polarised- also zero!
Experiments- Laser beam is not actually a plane wave, other components present that give us a finite result.


Sayak- Black hole thermodynamics.
Why black holes don't have infinite entropy (they absorb infinite energy; or information)
Statistical definition of entropy- <log(Pi)> Pi- probability of occupancy of a state.
Schwarzschild radius: Rs = 2 MG/c^2
Wants one bit of information to enter the black hole (uses photons)
If the wavelength of the photon is comparable to Rs, then it's delocalised over the entire volume, we deal with one bit of information- whether the photon has gone in or not.
Er = hc/l (l = wavelength of the photon)
dM = h/Rs*c
dR = 2G/c^2 dM = 2Gh/(c^3*Rs) dM
A- area, S- number of bits
dA = ShG/c^3
S = c^3dA/(Gh)
Finiteness of h ensures that entropy does not go to infinity.
dE = TdS
Tc^3A/(Gh) = hc/R
T = h^2/(MA)
T is inversely proportional to Energy!
Negative heat capacity- unstable system.
